# 🏠 Bangalore House Price Prediction

This project is a **machine learning web application** that predicts house prices in Bangalore, India.  
The application uses a **Random Forest Regressor** model trained on a cleaned dataset of real estate properties.  
The web interface is built using **Flask**, allowing users to input various house features and get an estimated price.

## ✨ Features

- **Data Cleaning and EDA**:  
  The `Bangalore_House_Prediction_Cleaning.ipynb` notebook details the data cleaning process, including:
  - Handling missing values  
  - Removing duplicates  
  - Feature engineering  
  - Outlier detection and removal (e.g., minimum square feet per BHK, price per square feet)

- **Machine Learning Models**:  
  The `Bangalore_House_Prediction_Model.ipynb` notebook demonstrates training of several regression models:
  - Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and XGBoost  
  - Performance comparison using **R-squared** and **RMSE**  
  - Random Forest Regressor showed the **highest accuracy** and was chosen for deployment

- **Web Application**:  
  - Built with **Python + Flask**  
  - `app.py` handles backend logic, renders HTML, and processes predictions  
  - `index.html` provides a form for input (BHK, square feet, bathrooms, balconies, area type, location)

- **Model Deployment**:  
  - Trained Random Forest model and StandardScaler are saved with **joblib**  
  - Easy loading for real-time predictions in the Flask app

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Insights

* **Missing Values**:

  * `society` column dropped (41.3% missing)
  * `balcony` filled with median
  * Rows with missing `location` and `size` dropped (few in number)

* **Feature Engineering**:

  * Created `size_bhk` (number of bedrooms extracted from `size`)
  * Cleaned `total_sqft` (ranges like "1000-1200" replaced by averages)
  * Removed outliers based on **sqft per BHK ratio**
  * Simplified `location` by grouping less frequent values as **"other"**
  * Converted `availability` into binary (1 = Ready To Move, 0 = Others)

* **Encoding**:

  * One-hot encoding for categorical features (`area_type`, `location`)
