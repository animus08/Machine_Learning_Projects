Bangalore House Price PredictionThis project is a machine learning web application that predicts house prices in Bangalore, India. The application uses a Random Forest Regressor model trained on a cleaned dataset of real estate properties. The web interface is built using Flask, allowing users to input various house features and get an estimated price.Project ComponentsBangalore_House_Prediction_Cleaning.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook details the data cleaning process. It addresses missing values, handles data inconsistencies (like ranges in total_sqft), and performs feature engineering. It also includes an important step of outlier detection based on common real estate assumptions.Bangalore_House_Prediction_Model.ipynb: This notebook focuses on the machine learning part of the project. It explores several regression models, including Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest. The Random Forest Regressor model was selected for the final application due to its superior performance (R-squared score of 0.996).model.py: This script contains the core machine learning logic. It loads the pre-trained Random Forest model and a StandardScaler for preprocessing new data, and includes a function to predict house prices based on a set of input features.app.py: This is the Flask web application. It handles the web server, renders the HTML user interface, and processes user-submitted data to generate and display a price prediction by calling the model.py script.index.html: The front-end of the web application. It provides a user-friendly form with dropdown menus for location and area_type and input fields for other house features.How to Run the ApplicationTo get the application up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:Clone the repository:git clone [your-repository-url]
cd Bangalore_House_Prediction
Install dependencies:Make sure you have Python installed, then install the necessary libraries using pip:pip install Flask scikit-learn numpy pandas joblib
Run the Flask application:From the project directory, run the app.py file.python app.py
Access the application:Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to start predicting house prices.Machine Learning Model PerformanceThe project evaluated several models to find the best fit.
